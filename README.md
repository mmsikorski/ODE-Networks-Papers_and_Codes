# ODE Neural Networks

Below I gather interesting and valuable papers about Physics-Informed Neural Networks, sometimes called ODE-NN (Ordinary differential equation - Neural Network)

ODE-NN are rather new field in neural network

## The most important papers 

1. **Neural differential ordinary equations**, *Yulia Rubanova, Ricky T. Q. Chen, David Duvenaud*, NeurIPS 2018, 2021. [[paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07366.pdf)]

It's high likely that papers above is a milestone in an area of neural networks that involves physics. In this paper, main ideas are in using theory od dynamical systems to construct architecture of neural network and in observation that a index used to numerate hidden layers in neural network can be viewed, in terms of limitation when index undergoes to infinity, as a time step that indicate when an information flow through a network.
